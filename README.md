# ðŸ“ˆ Demand Forecasting System for Retail (Quantile Regression + ClearML)

This project implements a **multi-horizon, multi-quantile demand forecasting pipeline** for retail sales using `QuantileRegressor`.  
It includes **automated feature generation**, **ClearML pipelines**, **quantile-based evaluation**, and a **business-focused metric: missed profits**.

---

## Problem Statement

Forecast demand for each SKU for the next 7, 14, and 21 days using past sales history.  
Key goals:
- Quantify uncertainty (quantile regression)
- Generate interpretable features
- Evaluate using business-impact metrics (missed profits)

---

## Key Features

âœ… Fully automated ML pipeline (using `ClearML`)  
âœ… Custom quantile loss + bootstrap confidence intervals  
âœ… Rolling feature generation (quantile, average)  
âœ… Per-SKU models trained in parallel  
âœ… Business metric: **missed profit** estimation  
âœ… Modular codebase, easy to extend or adapt

## Pipeline Overview

Raw orders (.csv or Yandex.Disk) â†’ Feature engineering â†’ Targets â†’ Train/Test split â†’  
Per-SKU QuantileRegressor training â†’ Predictions â†’ Evaluation (quantile loss, missed profits) â†’ Model saved

```python
features = {
    "qty_7d_avg": ("qty", 7, "avg", None),
    "qty_14d_q50": ("qty", 14, "quantile", 50),
    ...
}

targets = {
    "next_7d": ("qty", 7),
    "next_14d": ("qty", 14),
    "next_21d": ("qty", 21),
}
```

## Evaluation Example

```python
from evaluate import evaluate_model

losses = evaluate_model(df_test, df_pred, quantiles=[0.1, 0.5, 0.9], horizons=[7, 14, 21])
print(losses)
```

## Business Metric: Missed Profits

`test/missed_profit.py` includes:

- Weekly missed revenue due to underforecasting
    
- Confidence intervals via bootstrapping
    
- Relative loss (% of total revenue)

## Tech Stack

- ðŸ§  `sklearn.linear_model.QuantileRegressor`
    
- âš¡ `joblib` for parallel model training
    
- ðŸ“ˆ `ClearML` for orchestrating training pipeline
    
- ðŸ“Š `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `TQDM`, `Fire`
    
- ðŸ“¦ Lightweight, no deep learning dependencies

## Launch Pipeline (Yandex.Disk Example)
